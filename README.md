The goal of the game is to guide a frog to each of the empty "frog homes" at the top of the screen. To reach the "frog homes", players can navigate the frog in four directions to pass through different obstacles along the way.

In this simple version of Frogger, there are two levels. The frog has three lives for each level and can obtain extra lives along the way.
